It is not just the loss of a physical place, but of a support network, a social role, and a cultural identity. At 'Como en casa', we help you understand that feeling sad, disoriented, or even irritable is part of the journey. \n\nTo navigate it healthily, it is vital to allow yourself to feel these emotions without judgment. Maintaining contact with your roots while building new bridges in your destination is the balance we seek. Remember: you didn't leave to suffer, you left to grow, and growth sometimes hurts.",

Establishing a 'mental survival kit' is essential: a defined work schedule, moments of total digital disconnection, and the search for local communities, even if only for a short time.\n\nIn our sessions, we work on creating emotional anchors that do not depend on a specific geographic location. Your home is not an address, it is you.",

Video calls eliminate geographical barriers and allow people with high mobility, such as digital nomads, to maintain a continuity that was previously impossible.\n\nThe comfort of your own space and schedule flexibility are competitive advantages that reduce dropout rates and increase commitment to the therapeutic process.",
